# 🚀 Day 0: The Foundation & Setup

> **Project Goal:** Establish a robust, thread-safe Spring Boot foundation to build a custom API Rate Limiter from scratch.
> **Constraint:** Strict "No-AI" coding policy. All implementations rely on official documentation, raw problem-solving, and manual debugging.

# 🛡️ Day 1: The Gatekeeper (API Rate Limiter)

> **Core Concept:** Protecting API endpoints from abuse and spam using a custom-built Fixed Window Counter algorithm.
> **Constraint:** Strict "No-AI" coding policy. Built entirely from scratch using raw Java and Spring Boot documentation.

## ❓ The What and The Why

* **What is it?** A security layer (filter) that sits in front of a web server. It limits how many times a single user can hit the API within a specific timeframe (5 requests per 10 seconds).
* **Why build it?** To prevent server crashes from DDoS attacks, stop users from spamming endpoints, and deeply understand how HTTP requests flow through a backend system.
* **Why not use a library?** Building it from scratch forces a deep understanding of thread-safe memory handling (`ConcurrentHashMap`), custom HTTP responses, and filter chains.

## 🧠 Data Flow & Architecture

Below is the logical flow of how the custom rate limiter processes every incoming request.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Incoming HTTP Request] --> B[RateLimitFilter Intercepts]
    B --> C{Extract Client IP}
    C --> D{Is IP in Memory?}
    
    D -- No (First Visit) --> E[Create RequestInfo: Count=1, Time=Now]
    E --> F[Save to ConcurrentHashMap]
    F --> G[Pass to Controller: 200 OK]
    
    D -- Yes (Returning IP) --> H{Is Time Diff > 10 Seconds?}
    
    H -- Yes (Window Expired) --> I[Reset Count=1, Update Time=Now]
    I --> J[Save to Map & Pass to Controller: 200 OK]
    
    H -- No (Still in Window) --> K{Is Count < 5?}
    
    K -- Yes --> L[Increment Count +1]
    L --> M[Save to Map & Pass to Controller: 200 OK]
    
    K -- No (Spam Detected) --> N[Halt Filter Chain]
    N --> O[Return Custom Response: 429 Too Many Requests]

```
## 🛠️ how it was built (step-by-step)

### 1. the bouncer (`RateLimitFilter.java`)
i made a class that extends `OncePerRequestFilter`. this acts like a guard that catches every single http request before it even reaches the main controller.

### 2. the custom memory object (`RequestInfo.java`)
a normal map can only hold one value. but i needed to track two things:
* `requestCount`: how many times the user clicked.
* `windowStartTime`: the exact time they made their first click.
  so, i built a custom object just to hold these two variables together safely.

### 3. the thread-safe vault (`ConcurrentHashMap`)
spring boot handles many users at the same time using different threads. if i used a normal `HashMap`, the app would crash if two people clicked at the same millisecond. so i used `ConcurrentHashMap` to safely link a user's ip address to their `RequestInfo` data.

### 4. the math and the block
i used `System.currentTimeMillis()` to check the time difference. if a user makes more than 5 requests inside a 10-second window, the filter completely stops the process. it then manually writes a `429 too many requests` error directly back to the user using the `HttpServletResponse`.

## 🧪 how to test

1. open the project in your ide and run the `RatelimiterApplication.java` file.
2. open **postman**.
3. make a `GET` request to `http://localhost:8080/api/test`.
4. it will show `200 ok` and your success message.
5. click the "send" button 6 times really fast.
6. on the 6th click, it will block you and show a red `429 too many requests` status code.
7. wait 10 seconds, click send again, and you will get `200 ok` again.

## 🚀 Production Readiness & Edge Cases

While the current `ConcurrentHashMap` implementation is a mathematically sound **Fixed Window Counter** for a single-server instance, deploying this to a massive production environment exposes a few architectural edge cases.

Here is how this system would be upgraded for enterprise scalability:

### 1. The Distributed Memory Problem (Multi-Server)
* **The Edge Case:** In production, APIs sit behind a Load Balancer that routes traffic to multiple server instances (e.g., Server A and Server B). Since our `ConcurrentHashMap` lives inside the local memory of a single Java JVM, Server B has no idea how many requests Server A just processed for a user.
* **The Solution:** Move the state out of the application. Replace the local `ConcurrentHashMap` with **Redis**. Redis acts as a centralized, ultra-fast, in-memory database that all server instances read from and write to simultaneously.


### 2. The Memory Leak Risk (OOM)
* **The Edge Case:** Currently, every new IP address is permanently added to the map. If a million unique users hit the API over a month, the map grows infinitely until the Java application throws an `OutOfMemoryError` and crashes.
* **The Solution:** Implement a **Time-To-Live (TTL)**. If using Redis, you configure the key to automatically delete itself after 10 seconds. If staying purely in Java, a scheduled background thread (e.g., using Spring's `@Scheduled`) must be written to sweep the map and clean up expired `RequestInfo` objects every few minutes.

### 3. The Proxy Trick (IP Spoofing)
* **The Edge Case:** Malicious users or bots can easily bypass an IP-based rate limiter by rapidly rotating their IP addresses using VPNs or proxy pools.
* **The Solution:** Instead of tracking `request.getRemoteAddr()`, secure production endpoints apply rate limits based on authenticated identities. This means extracting a logged-in `user_id` from a JWT token, or requiring an `x-api-key` in the request headers and tracking that specific key's usage.

## 📚 official resources used

since this was built completely from scratch without ai writing the code, i used these official docs to figure out the logic:
* [spring boot filter docs](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/reference/web/webmvc-filters.html)
* [java 17 ConcurrentHashMap docs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/util/concurrent/ConcurrentHashMap.html)
* [mdn web docs for 429 status](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status/429)

## 🧪 How to Test Locally

1. Start the Spring Boot application (`TaskQueueApplication.java`).
2. Open **Postman** and create a new `POST` request to `http://localhost:8080/api/reports`.
3. **The Single Test:** Click **Send** once.
  * *Postman:* Instantly returns `202 Accepted` and a success message.
  * *Terminal:* Prints `Processing: Report_Task_...`, pauses for 5 seconds, then prints `Finished: Report_Task_...`.
4. **The Stress Test:** Click **Send** 5 times as fast as possible.
  * *Postman:* Instantly returns 5 consecutive `202 Accepted` responses with zero lag.
  * *Terminal:* The background worker processes them sequentially, taking 25 seconds total, proving the main web thread was completely unblocked.

## 🚀 Edge Cases & Production Improvements

While `LinkedBlockingQueue` is perfectly thread-safe for a single instance, relying on in-memory queues introduces risks in an enterprise environment. Here is how to make this architecture production-ready:

### 1. The Volatile Memory Problem (Data Loss)
* **The Edge Case:** If the server suddenly crashes, restarts, or is scaled down by a load balancer, every single task currently sitting in the `LinkedBlockingQueue` is permanently deleted from RAM.
* **The Solution:** Swap the in-memory queue for a persistent **Message Broker** like **RabbitMQ**, **Apache Kafka**, or **AWS SQS**. These tools save messages to a hard drive so tasks survive server crashes.

### 2. The Bottleneck (Single Consumer)
* **The Edge Case:** Right now, there is only one worker thread. If 1,000 users request a report that takes 5 seconds to build, the 1,000th user will wait almost an hour and a half for their report to process.
* **The Solution:** Implement a **Thread Pool** (e.g., Java's `ExecutorService`) to spin up 10 or 20 concurrent worker threads. In a distributed system, you would spin up entirely separate "Consumer" microservices that pull from the same Kafka topic.

### 3. The Silent Failure (Dropped Tasks)
* **The Edge Case:** If the worker encounters an error while processing a task (e.g., a database timeout or null pointer), the task crashes and is lost forever. The user never gets their report.
* **The Solution:** Implement a **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)**. If a task fails 3 times, it is moved to a separate "failure queue" where developers can inspect it, and the worker moves on to the next task.

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

If I were to expand this project, I would add:
1. **Database Integration:** Save the task ID to a PostgreSQL database with a status of `PENDING`, `PROCESSING`, or `COMPLETED`.
2. **Status Endpoint:** Create a `GET /api/reports/{id}` endpoint so the frontend client can check if their specific background task is finished yet.
